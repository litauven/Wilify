                You're such a motivator, gotta get your way
                So sick of saying, "Yes sir, yes sir"
                You're such an instigator, you wanna play the game
                Take it or leave it, that's her, that's her
                And I can't wait another minute
                I can't take the look she's giving
                Your body rocking, keep me up all night
                One in a million, my lucky strike (ooh)
                Got me so high, and then she dropped me
                But she got me, she got me, she got me, yeah (ooh)
                Took me inside, and then she rocked me
                She keep me up all night, this is what it sounds like
                my lucky strike
                (Oh) my lucky strike
                (Oh) your body rocking, keep me up all night
                (Oh) one in a million, my lucky strike
                Stuck in her elevator, she take me to the sky
                And I don't wanna go down, go down (oh)
                She said, "I'll feel you later, go ahead and fantasize"
                She make me want her right now, right now (oh)
                And I can't wait another minute
                I can't take the look she's giving
                Your body rocking, keep me up all night
                One in a million, my lucky strike (ooh)
                Got me so high, and then she dropped me
                But she got me, she got me, she got me, yeah (ooh)
                Took me inside, and then she rocked me
                She keep me up all night, this is what it sounds like
                my lucky strike
                (Oh) my lucky strike
                (Oh) your body rocking, keep me up all night
                (Oh) one in a million, my lucky strike
                Hey, you're taking all my pain away
                You're shaking like an earthquake
                Hey, you're taking all my pain away
                You're shaking like an earthquake
                (Ooh)
