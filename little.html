                I met somebody, selfless and kind
                She's got a smile even when she isn't fine
                She can be hurting, but she's got enough love to fill up Tennessee
                I met somebody, stays up at night
                I see her worry and she sees all of mine
                I met somebody, she really loves me, says I'm all she needs
                And I
                Grew up thinking I would have to
                Fight all of this alone
                But now you hold me in the darkness
                Hold me 'til it hurts less, you
                Tell me that I'm alright
                Show me where the light shines through
                Please, stay, love me through the weather
                Please, say this will be forever
                Hold me in the darkness
                Even when it's hard with you
                It's a little bit, little bit better
                I met somebody, gentle and smart
                He underestimates the size of his heart
                He can be laughing, but he's got enough pain to fill up New York City
                I met somebody so full of scars
                The world's on his shoulders, but he won't fall apart
                I met somebody, he really loves me, says I'm all he needs
                And I
                Grew up thinking I would have to
                Fight all of this alone
                But now you hold me in the darkness
                Hold me 'til it hurts less, you
                Tell me that I'm alright
                Show me where the light shines through
                Please, stay, love me through the weather
                Please, say this will be forever
                Hold me in the darkness
                Even when it's hard with you
                It's a little bit, little bit better
                Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
                A little bit better
                Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
                And I
                Grew up thinking I would have to
                Fight all of this alone
                But now you hold me in the darkness
                Hold me 'til it hurts less, you
                Tell me that I'm alright
                Show me where the light shines through
                Please, stay, love me through the weather
                Please, say this will be forever
                Hold me in the darkness
                Even when it's hard with you
                It's a little bit, little bit better
